## ðŸŽ°Slot-MachineðŸŽ°
### A game where the user can play a slot machine, betting on any and all lines of a 3 x 3 grid.
The player chooses their lines and how much to bet on each of them, then the slot machine will randomly generate a 3 x 3 grid and 
iterate through all the chosen lines verifying if they have matching values.
When a matching set is confirmed the bet amount gets multiplied and added onto the running total. 

The goal of this game is a test of luck, it continues until the total amount of money runs out or the player decides to cashout.
